## Overview

The Note Taker is an app designed for creating, storing, and viewing your personal notes. Simply create a note with a title and a body on the right side of the screen, then hit the Save button in the top-left of the Notes page to save your note to the application server. Your saved notes will show up on the left side of the screen - click on any saved note's title to read it, or delete a note using the red Delete button next to its title.

This project builds upon code provided by the UCSD San Diego Coding Boot Camp. The server and database code, however, are original, and some changes were made to the front-end JavaScript (primarily to allow server functionality).

## Programs Used
This project was completed with Javascript (2020 Build) and Node.JS in Visual Studio Code 1.56.2. It also requires the express and fs libraries, which can be installed using npm.
